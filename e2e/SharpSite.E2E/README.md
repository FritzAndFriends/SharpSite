# SharpSite.E2E

This is the first end-to-end testing project for SharpSite.  It uses xUnit and Playwright to exercise the application and ensure things are working properly.

## Folder Structure

There are three main folders in use inside this project to enable different C# capabilities that we need in order to execute tests using playwright the folders are

- **Abstractions** contains the resources that we reuse across multiple tests
- **Fixtures** contains the test classes
- **Navigation** contains extra classes that help with navigating the website
